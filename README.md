# liatrio-apprentice

Currently a work in progress!

A simple web application that uses Node.js, Express.js, and other tools to create a simple web application which returns a JSON object via a API request. Will use a CI/CD pipeline, containers, and will be deployed to a cloud platform.

Tools Used:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Docker
- GitHub

These should fail right now:
